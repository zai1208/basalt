                      TUI Application to manage Obsidian
                 vaults and notes directly from the terminal.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
            %version-notice


DISCLAIMER

  Basalt is in its early stages, with a very limited set of features, and is
  therefore susceptible to changes. Currently, the major drawback of Basalt is
  the inability to modify any notes. Another limitation is the missing or
  incomplete rendering of certain markdown styles. However, these features will
  be prioritized in the next version.

  Quitting the application may feel a bit abrupt, as the application exits
  immediately after pressing ‹q›. I have some plans to handle this differently
  in the future. For example, through a series of button presses or by using
  command inputs similar to Vim's ‹:quit› or ‹:q›.

VAULT SELECTION

  On startup screen you can select the Vault you want to view. Any open vaults
  are shown with a ◆ symbol marker.

    ‹q›         Quit the application
    ‹?›         Show this help
    ‹k›         Move selection up
    ‹j›         Move selection down
    ‹↩ Enter›   Select and open the highlighted vault

  The vault selection can be brought up as a modal by hitting ‹Ctrl+G› after
  the startup screen.

INTERFACE

  The application has two main panes: the Explorer (file browser) on the left
  and the Note Viewer on the right. You can switch between these panes using
  the Tab key. The currently active pane will be highlighted and name of the
  active pane is displayed in the lower left corner of the application.

  EXPLORER PANE

    Browse and select notes from your vault.

    The explorer shows all notes and folders in your vault. You can navigate up
    and down through the list, and press Enter to select and view a note. The
    explorer panel can be toggled on/off to give more space to the note viewer.

      ‹q›         Quit the application
      ‹?›         Show this help
      ‹Esc›       Cancel/close modals
      ‹Tab›       Switch to note viewer pane
      ‹k / j›     Move selection up / down
      ‹↑ / ↓›     Move selection up / down
      ‹s›         Toggle note sorting
      ‹t›         Toggle explorer panel visibility
      ‹↩ Enter›   Select and view the highlighted note

      ‹Ctrl+G›    Toggle vault selector modal
      ‹Ctrl+B›    Toggle explorer panel visibility
      ‹Ctrl+U›    Scroll up half a page
      ‹Ctrl+D›    Scroll down half a page

  NOTE VIEWER PANE

    Read and navigate through your selected note.

    The note viewer displays the content of the selected note in a readable
    format. You can scroll through the content using the arrow keys or
    vim-style navigation.

      ‹q›         Quit the application
      ‹?›         Show this help
      ‹Esc›       Cancel/close modals
      ‹Tab›       Switch to explorer pane
      ‹k / j›     Scroll up / down
      ‹↑ / ↓›     Scroll up / down
      ‹t›         Toggle explorer panel visibility

      ‹Ctrl+G›    Toggle vault selector modal
      ‹Ctrl+B›    Toggle explorer panel visibility
      ‹Ctrl+U›    Scroll up half a page
      ‹Ctrl+D›    Scroll down half a page
