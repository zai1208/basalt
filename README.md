TUI Application to manage Obsidian vaults and notes directly from the terminal ✨.

<img src="assets/basalt_demo.gif">

## Installation

For now unfortunately, you have to compile this binary yourself, if you want to run basalt. The next thing I'll be doing is adding a GitHub workflow to produce cross-platform binaries.

Install basalt using cargo:

```sh
cargo install basalt-tui
```

## Background

This is something that has been brewing in my head for quite some time. There has been different incarnations over the years, however, nothing as substantial as this.

I have been using Neovim and the official Obsidian app. However, I wanted to have something dedicated that offers the same writing experience as Neovim, but has more WYSIWYG experience as in the official Obsidian app. I'm fully aware of (obsidian.nvim)[https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim], which many people use and find more than sufficient. However, I want to see images, beautified text, note graphs, etc. I want it to be a bit more.

The problem for me personally is that when I leave the terminal, my flow breaks, especially if I'm writing. Using an entirely different app disrupts that flow, and it _annoys_ me. So here I am, building a TUI for Obsidian.

The goal of basalt is not to replace the Obsidian app. Basalt is to fill and cater for a need to have a terminal view to the selection of notes and vaults, providing quick access from anywhere in the terminal with a simple command.

## Keybindings

For now these are not configurable, but this will change when the configuration file is supported.

<kbd>q</kbd> Quit the application

<kbd>?</kbd> Show help

<kbd>t</kbd> Toggle side panel visibility and select mode

<kbd>k</kbd> Move selection up

<kbd>j</kbd> Move selection down

<kbd>↑ / ↓</kbd> Scroll selected up / down

<kbd>↩ Enter</kbd> Select the highlighted note

<kbd>Space</kbd> Toggle vault selector modal

<kbd>Ctrl-u</kbd> Scroll up half a page

<kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> Scroll down half a page

## Task List

    - [ ] Run create release artifacts (cross-platform binaries)
    - [ ] Run vhs when basalt dir changes and commit it to the current PR
- [ ] Async file loading (tokio)
- [ ] Persistent scroll state in help modal
- [ ] Fuzzy search in panes (note, sidepanel, modals)
- [ ] Markdown rendering
    - [ ] Add support to all markdown nodes
    - [ ] Add text formatting to different styles like Fraktur and DoubleStruck for heading purposes

    - [ ] Edit and save notes
    - [ ] Support some vim keybindings to get started (vim mode should be configurable option)
    - [ ] Easy text yanking

- [ ] Integration tests using https://core.tcl-lang.org/expect/index
- [ ] When creating a link show autocomplete tooltip list of potential files to link to
- [ ] Add features to basalt-core and basalt-widgets. Default feature set and individual features.
- [ ] Clickable checkboxes

## I want to help

I haven't yet had the chance to add a contributors' guide. If you would like to help, please feel free to create a pull request directly. At this stage, opening a separate issue is not required unless you would like to start a discussion first.

Please note that this process may change in the future. The expected contribution flow will likely become: Create issue → Create pull request.

There's a useful pre-push git-hook under `scripts`, which you can enable by running the following command:

```
cp scripts/pre-push .git/hooks/
```

The script runs the same test commands as in the `test.yml` workflow.
