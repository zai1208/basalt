> [!WARNING]
>
> The current implementation of the Basalt note editor is _experimental_ and _subject to change_.
>
> The key change I anticipate for the editor is a custom implementation built from scratch that will enable a better [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) experience.

To enable the experimental editor feature, you must add the following configuration to your Basalt configuration file:

```toml
experimental_editor = true
```

## Modes

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In the future, the modes will follow the Obsidian modes more strictly: Reading, Live Preview Editing, and Source Mode Editing.

### Read Mode
